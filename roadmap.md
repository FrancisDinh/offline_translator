# 📱 Offline Travel Translator - Roadmap

## 🌟 Vision

Build a simple, offline-first Android app for travelers — especially older adults and non-English speakers.

- Offer easy-to-use speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and editable conversation templates.

## 🧭 Core Principles

- **Offline-first experience**: Everything important works without internet.
- **Minimal battery and storage usage**: Lightweight for low-end Android devices.
- **Simple, accessible UI**: Large text, clear buttons, easy navigation.
- **Lean MVP**: Start with essential features; allow more to be added later.
